.. I just go, icky ficky ficky!

It's all getting a bit out of control. The mythtv box, which I'm now
running tt-rss and roundcube on frequently crashes running out of
memory. Turns out it's only ever had 1 GB of ram in it which is pretty
good going for a combined back/frontend. I've had to disable apache to
keep the WAF. I've ordered a Zotac ND22 for a frontend from PriceUSA
(about \$300 delivered) and it's on its way.

I've now got a VPS with Quickweb for serving video's quicker to the
folks back home. At some point I'll knock up a basic javascript gallery
streaming site on it. As well as host my tt-rss and cube sites. I'm
quite impressed with it so far. (lowendscript for teh w1n)

The debian desktop is a tragedy. It throws random segfaults on any heavy
process. Much swapping of parts has narrowed it down to the motherboard
which I'll now attempt to RMA. Oddly enough one of my replacement parts
is a \$40 sempron 140. A single core chip with the mobo has successfully
unlocked to dual core. Nice. :)
