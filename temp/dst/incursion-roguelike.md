\>For some reason I never got around to writing about this before. Some
months ago I decided to get into Mac software development but being a
jaded gamer that can't see to stay on the wagon I was addicted to a game
called Incursion-Roguelike. Incursion is a classic roguelike in the same
vein as the famous Nethack and Adom but uses the D20 ruleset from
Wizards of the Coast. Think a Nethack version of Neverwinter Nights and
you have it. It rocks. It also differs from traditional roguelikes in
that it uses the Allegro library for it's graphics instead of plain old
ncurses. This means that it can't run in a terminal, but what it also
means is that it can be easily ported to Mac.

To get back into C programming, my last effort of which was fishbot, an
error prone and maniacal IRC bot written in C on the Amiga, I offered to
port Incursion to the Mac. This turned out to be fairly easy and was a
good primer in getting familiar with XCode and the Mac build system.
I've been maintaining Mac Incursion for over 6 months now and can pump
out a new build in less than 5 minutes.

Incursion Roguelike for Mac can be found on the [official Incursion
website][].
