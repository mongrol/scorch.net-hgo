Now I'm back into the actual game proper and done with PCG for the time
being, I've quickly realised that my old ranged attack code sucks quite
badly. I also jammed melee attack code into it without fully realising
how sucky it was. The result is some ugly components that are out of
order and also are probably wrongly tightly coupled to the AI system as
well.

Ah, I had good 3 months since my last re-factoring exercise. Here we go
again, again.
