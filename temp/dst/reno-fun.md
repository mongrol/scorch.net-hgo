\>We've finally, nine months after getting plans drawn up, engaged a
builder to start the extension of Freedom Cottage. However, 2 months in
and engaged is all we've managed to do. Windows and steel is ordered but
there's some trouble with the concrete slab underneath. The council here
demand thousands of dollars if you want to change your curtains and the
certifier wants proof the slab underneath if cool. This is a problem. I
have no documents on it and an no engineer will ever come out and sign
it off as it's already laid. Previous owners are uncontactable and the
certifier who done that previous work was recently struck off for
professional misconduct. Concrete is fun.

At worst case I'll have to dig it up and relay it. Probably costing
about \$10,000. Negotiations will decide that this week.
