Trainset by Toys'r'Us. Table by Ozzy. After the Thomas Tank engine
exhibition at the Ipswich railway museum I realised we needed a table
quicksmart so I got stuck into it. What we have here is a mitred frame
surrounded by a larger mitred frame to provide a lip and facia. The legs
are fixed to both the frame and facia with gold coloured bolts. The
table top is standard 15x600x900mm MDF which is double sided. On one
side we have a trainset and the other is plain white. The tabletop just
sits in the frame so we can easily pop it out, turn it over and Coop can
scribble, colour in, throw blocks at it or whatever. I'm still undecided
on whether to epoxy the trainset to the top or not. I've already glued
most of it together to stop it coming apart. The whole thing is made out
of cheapo pine and finished off with industrial grade marine varnish to
withstand what will no doubt be a good playing on.

The trainset is a Thomas compatible sized wooden railway range called
Imaginarium. Learning Curve have a cheek charging the prices they do for
Thomas wooden railway stuff. Especially since its made in the same
Chinese sweatshops as the cheaper stuff.

I'm quite chuffed with this. Made in record time of less than a week
with only minor mistakes requiring more wood. (I stuck the legs on
pointing upwards would you believe?). Now what can I make next?
