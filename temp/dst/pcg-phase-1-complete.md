Phew, that took some doing. For my first PCG map "farm" I've used
Cellular Automation for tree generation. This took some tweaking to get
right with some random variables liberally sprinkled to get the right
amount of clumping and spacing. I didn't want a cavern type thick forest
and it was only a couple of integers away from wide open fields with
only trees around the edges. Still, I've enough to get on with. I then
drawn a road from left to right randomly varying the Y coordinate to
make it wander a bit. It's not that clever but good enough to get on
with. These coupled with my 5x5 and 10x10 building tiles is making a
suitably random farm type map every time.

So, that out of the way I need to go back to progression. I'm going to
remove the static content just now while I figure out how to fit in the
storyline. I'll change to a simple equip, map, levelup sequence that'll
allow me to start looking at balance and more item contents.
