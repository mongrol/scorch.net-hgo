\>As I said below I'm now a budding Mac developer. To learn any
programming language I always need a personal project that fills a gap
that can't be filled from anywhere else. In this case its a decent
personal finance program. Out recent run in with the bank manager has
left us a bit strapped and I always new cash flow was a bit of a problem
since we moved here. We simply always spend more than we make and the
missus doesn't see this as a problem as the machine just keeps giving
her money. Once we tallied up what we were spending versus what we make
we needed to put it right. That's where [envelope budgeting][] comes in.

Simple put, its a method of stuffing money into envelopes allocated to a
particular item, like food, electricity etc. Unlike most finance
programs that track where your money has went and that's their idea of
helping you budget. Envelope budgeting makes sure you have money for an
item BEFORE we spend it on something else.

On the Mac there's two envelope budgeting programs. Moneywell and
Budget. Both are well established and able programs but never suited my
needs so I'm writing my own. I'll elaborate on why they don't suit me in
a later post. moolah, is written in Objective-C and Cocoa and it's open
source. It's almost in a usable state for the daring. Get it [here][].
