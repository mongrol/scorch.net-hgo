\>Bubzilla \#2 arrived yesterday 31st December 2009 at 5.17pm with no
drama at all. Hazel had some "stomach pains" overnight which developed
into minor contractions in the morning. After all the chaos of Cooper's
birth we were reluctant to even phone in, only to be sent home again.
However, they were fairly regular and speeding up fast. 15 mins apart at
9am then 10mins apart at 1pm. We phoned in, Cooper was at daycare and in
we went with bags packed.

<div>
Contractions then were about 7 mins apart (my god this is going fast).
We impressed this acceleration apon the staff who, in their usual
relaxed manner (how can you relax, someones about to give birth!!),
declined to see the urgency. One examination later told us she was 4-5cm
dilated and wasn't going anywhere except a birthing suite.

I race back to daycare, pick Cooper up and deposit him on to a mate
(Thanks Ste for watching him) then back to the hossie. Hazel's in birth
suite 16, bub's facing transverse instead of OP. Goodo. We again impress
the urgency on the staff for an epidural as we don't want caught with an
OP baby with no decent pain control. Bloke turns up, sticks a needle in
here back and we're good in 30 mins.

I read a book for a bit, while some more tube insertion goes on. By this
time it's 4 mins to 5pm, Hazel panicks a bit thinking her insides are
coming out. She's right, they are. Membrane bursts. Some cleanup is
performed and in a few mins another midwife team leader appears, they
say it's time to have a baby and to start pushing.

7 minutes of pretty good pushing has Molly out into the world with good
skin to skin and she started feeding pretty much straight away. It's
such a positive contrast with Cooper's birth. We had such a traumatic
time with him and this happened so fast and so straight forward it makes
me want 6 more!! Only kidding. :) Pics
soon.<span style="white-space:pre;"> </span>
