\>A brief update of what can be described in business speak as "where
we're at and what we look like going forward".

<span style="font-weight:bold;">House</span>

Painters are finishing off the outside next week. The project is then
complete with only the inside to be finished. We're trying to get that
done quick smart as Coop is almost needing somewhere to stretch his
legs.

Disaster: The Beast has a busted gearbox. No idea whats wrong but its
going to involve dropping the box out the thing and taking a look at
whats most likely pieces of shrapnel. We have 3 weeks to do it as the
Bodgy Run is on the 16th and me and the bloke over the road (mechanic)
is entering hardcore class!

Joy: The Grand Vitara is sold! At last, we're a one and a half car
family.

Getting big, throwing balls around with direction deliberateness, saying
Dad a lot. :)
