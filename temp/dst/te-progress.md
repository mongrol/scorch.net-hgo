ARRP 2011 is now two months gone and I've so far, in my usual slow
fashion, implemented melee. I'm becoming more conscious of the usability
of the interface as this is exacerbated by the success of indie games
recently. User's have higher expectations and Indie games these days
have to strive to be as professional as larger company products. I
thought I could get away with poor UI by sticking to the roguelike genre
but now even RL's are coming out with slick interfaces (Dredmor,
Cardinal Quest).

Now melee is in I'm going to create a citizen faction. What we need is
some farmers blindly panicing while being slaughtered by brass worms.
I'll then shove out another release before tackling the procedural maps.

Also noticed some wobbly pathing issues when I implemented the melee
charge. It really needs a proper A\* routine but I'll just pretend
everyone has been on the oil for now. :)
