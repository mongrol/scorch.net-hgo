\>Getting quite large chunks of dev time on moolah recently but it all
seems to be going on maintenance of the existing code. I'm still not
what you would call an experienced Cocoa coder but even already I look
back at previous code and think wtf! I'm almost embarrassed to be in the
same room as myself.

The next major version bump to 0.7 will include basic reporting and a
framework for expanding reports fairly easily. Before I get there though
I'm reworking chunks of code that was banged in early on to get
functionality up and running. Until I get around to subclassing my own
tableview's to include type ahead functions and more intuitive keyboard
workflow I'm reverting the transactions views back to an instant write
to the database. The current method of entering transactions is a
shocking mess. :)

0.6.3 with added sanity due soon.
