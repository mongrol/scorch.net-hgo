I've done no dev in the last 4 weeks for a couple of main reasons. 1)
I've been hammered by anxiety and 2) I realise that with my current game
design I won't be finished for another 3 years at my current rate. So
it's time for the Traction Edge Simplification Project.

TE is my first game and first C++ program and it shows in terms of code
design. Normally new game programmers stick to simple games and get a
few out before tackling something bigger. I didn't do that and now 3
years down the line I fear losing enthusiasm for it which I don't want
to do. So design refresh time it is.

-   Simple items

I was going to stick to traditional roguelike inventory handling.
Players can find and pick up items on the battlefield. They can carry
many and can swap them, pass them to other players etc. I'm now changing
back to a very original plan and players will have 2 simple slots.
Wielding and Belt. The equivalent of left and right hand I suppose.
Players are equipped on the embark screen. Belt will hold things like a
grenade or a medikit.

This also has the advantage of make choices easier. A player can't carry
a grenade AND a medikit. It also means you can only carry one grenade
with you making the choice of when you use it much starker. I like this
plan. It's nice.

-   Item research

New items will appear at chosen levels. Like every 2 level or so you'll
get a new one. Perhaps I could do a research tree where you pick a
branch to travel down and it becomes available at level completion
(research happens while you're off in the field)

The idea is to keep the next release progressing rather than getting
bogged down in implementing a larger system that may take months.
