My coding fruition reaches new lows as it's taken nearly 10 weeks to
implement a save game feature. My god that was dull. In the end though,
it actually turned out easier, and more monotonous than I thought.
Loading all the data in and bootstrapping the game at whatever screen
I've chosen was a minimum of fuss and did show up some bad design
decisions made during my "just get it in and working" coding sprees. So
all good. What's next?

After nearly 2 years I now have enough engine to actually flesh the
gameplay out more. I've started an RPG model design wiki (vimwiki) to
write everything down. This is the fun bit as there are so many
different ways of doing things and I hope to employ many of the rules
from Jesse Schell's The Art Of Game Design book, which is truly
excellent. It's gave me lots to think about.

The next release of Traction Edge will be for ARRP 2011 on Sept 16th. It
should have the following changed features over last years release.

-   Actual FSM AI. It runs, hide, makes decisions, shoots etc
-   Reaction Fire. (Currently very reactive)
-   Tons of bugs fixed and new ones implemented.
-   More weapons and skills.
-   Initial implementation of the RPG system.

Not a great deal but considering nearly 9 months has been re-factoring
at my glacial pace at least it's something.
