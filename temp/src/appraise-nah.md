I had the appraise skill in and about to start using it when I realised
I didn't need it. What is an appraise skill anyway? It's based on
intelligence and lets you identify creatures and objects but you can't
raise it with skill points. This means UI work to avoid those
untrainable skills in the list. I then reassessed why I had this skill?
To test if creatures can identify other creatures and objects? It's only
based on intelligence so why would it exist at all. Let's just use
intelligence.

Bravery is a bit different. I want intelligent monsters to have some
idea of their toughness. If they are tough I want them to know they can
take more hits before doing a runner. So everytime we want to check this
chain, like when low on health, I'd want an INT check first to see if
we're clever enough to make a decision, then a STR and AC check to see
how resilient we are. (note to self: implement AC ;) )

What a handy blog. I solve my problems while typing out loud. :)
