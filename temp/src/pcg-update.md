Good progress today. A trip to Sydney resulted in much code being
written on the plane and in the airport. I now have 5x5 and 10x10
building placement into a base map with the config for each scenario
parsed from xml files. Next up is to tighten up the code as the rands
spring up the occasional segfault. Then it's a job of weighting the
placement a bit more central so buildings aren't so much jammed against
the edges of the map.

Very pleased so far. It's nice to see a random map every time I crank it
up and this will allow my next release to potentially have replayability
and the foundation for balancing and character progression. A real game!
