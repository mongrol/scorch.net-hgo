\>This weekend we went camping for the first time since The Miniskreeg
showed up. I have a camping checklist and it now has a "Cooper" section
in it with unforgettable items like dummies, portacots and ehgoo's.
Camping always has something missing but the impact of forgetting the
unforgettable when there's a baby involved is a magnitute greater than
normal. Luckily, all we forgot was good weather, which was both a
blessing and a curse. We coped well despite some setbacks but also
learned how difficult it is entertaining a toddler in a tent when its
raining.

Thing we need to add to the list.

-   Ground sheet - Cooper got utterly mockit in 5 minutes of arriving
-   Tarp + Poles - Even if going one night. Makes rain go away for
    cooking
-   Good esky. I mean a GOOD esky.

<div>
Cooper got up at 4am, it rained, we cooked breakfast, got wet, packed up
and left at 7am. It was a success though as we had a good curry and a
lot drink and idle camp chatter. Job done. :)
