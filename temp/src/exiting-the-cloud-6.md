In order to dump the Mac I need to replace it with something that meets
the equivalent Wife Acceptance Factor. I've managed to lower the WAF a
bit by explaining why I'm doing this. She appears to agree, or at the
very least, allowed me to my madness.

I've knocked up her a user on Debian. Made it nice and purple and put
her usual apps in a dock similar to the Mac. All good. Except for
iPhoto. She uses this heavily for printing and emailing pics. Nothing on
in Open Source land comes close to iPhoto or Picassa so I've stretched
out on a limb to meet the bare minimum of WAF.

The requirements are to be able to resize multiple pics and send via
email, print and edit in some manner. The candidates are Shotwell (base
Gnome install), gThumb, Picasa or F-Photo. gThumb is pretty basic and
doesn't email so thats out the window. Shotwell doesn't either though in
the incarnation that comes with Squeeze. I've had to dip into
experimental to pull out v8.1 to get a sendto function. So far it's been
stable. F-Photo uses Mono so it's against the grain to encourage such
dubious technology and it's far too slow anyway. Picasa works, is too
feature packed but is a proprietary blob belonging to Google that runs
on wine and looks like Windows.

I've settled on Shotwell v8 but a bug in nautilus-sendto means I have to
revert to Evolution instead of Icedove for sending pics. Shame as
Icedove is a far superior product in terms of UX.

In other news ttrss on my self hosted box is running really well so that
only leaves youtube to be replaced. I've a good mind to close it anyway
and solve the problem later.
