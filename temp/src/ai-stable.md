Fleeing monsters are now in, they do tend to do a bit of pillar dancing
in and out of FOV but I'll fix that later. Next up though I want to get
some individuality in and we can do that with the flee desire. I want
monsters to have different flee characteristics.

Mindless creatures, spiders, slithers to some degree should only flee at
the last resort. Larger ones should exhibit more intelligence and there
lies the balancing act.

It would be easy to gauge up the prowess of player and attacker and make
the attacker more skittish if the player is a lot more powerful.
However, this need to be weighted by the monsters intelligence. Cleverer
monsters are better at "appraising". This may be an opportunity to get
an appraise skill in and actually get the intelligence attribute into
play. Hmm, good idea Mongrol. Yes.
