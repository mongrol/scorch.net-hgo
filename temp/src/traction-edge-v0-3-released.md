Yay! That makes 3 releases in less than 3 years. Awesome! This is the
first release that I consider a playable game in that it allows you to
progress through several levels of increasing difficulty with the
ability to boost your skills during map intervals. I've also setup a new
home page domain [www.tractionedge.org][] which still goes to the
Sourceforge site but means I can move it here when I eventually get some
wordpress theme skills.

What's next then? Well since it's turning into a proper game I need to
go through another bout of code cleanup. First to die is the excessive
std::cout debug spam. This all has to go and I've found a lovely logging
library called "blah" to help with this. After that's done I'll get more
content in, monsters, weapons and scale the difficulty to allow players
to progress further than level 4 (it's kill hard at the moment).
