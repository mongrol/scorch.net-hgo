Just had a wee play through. I'm not very happy with the state of PCG as
it is. If I left it as it is I'd have to live with it for probably 6
months or more and it'll just piss me off. So, targets are.

\* Correct meandering roads and rivers.  
\* Correct blocks of trees  
\* Fill routines etc to deal with above.

The fill thing has me interested. It would be nice to say, fill this XY
Coord with A tile using B tile as the ground. And off it goes doing a
flood fill.

Roads and rivers I've thought about a bit but my habit of using loops
and layering on lots of rands and if's to vary things just seems
rubbish. There must be established methods of doing this sort of thing.

Duckduckgo to the rescue!
