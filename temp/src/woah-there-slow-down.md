7 days of builders doing stuff so far and they've done a hella lot.
Amazing what you can do when someones giving you money to do it. Stuff
done so far? Deck ripped up, sealed and nearly tiled, new concrete slab
down underneath, round side and behind carport for the tank. Posts and
cross timbers in for car port. Frame up for walls and back extension.
There's stuff just everywhere. Its like some mad builders construction
bomb has went off. Oh, and my water tank finally showed up. No! You
can't steal it, I've moved it over the fence.
