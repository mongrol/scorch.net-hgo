I've finally got another release successfully out he door last weekend.
v0.2 was punted out for the ARRP 2011. Main changes were updated AI,
reaction fire and stats affecting gameplay.

Since I'm only distributing source, and since the source is always
available and a release is only a sort of stable branch, I'm going to
aim at more regular releases. Here's the next features coming up.

-   Melee
-   Opening Doors
-   Civilians and more mobs.
-   Procedural maps
