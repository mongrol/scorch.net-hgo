\>The trick to a happy evening is to tire the child out during the day.
Keeping him "cooped" up in the house drives everyone nuts so at weekends
we like to get out places. Cooper loves pools, water, skiddling,
anything wet related. Sunday we took him up to the Redcliffe lagoon
which is a nice pool area beside the seaside. This kid is going to be
swimming unaided before he's 3 I reckon. He's already doggy paddling!
