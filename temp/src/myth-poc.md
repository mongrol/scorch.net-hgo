Before Miniskreeg hits the sheets I have certain milestones to reach.
One of these is the replacing of the current house PC (running Ubuntu
Feisty) with a Mac of some kind, probably a laptop since I can tax dodge
it and reincarnate the PC as a MythTV media centre. Shove it in a secure
cabinet under the house with the cables coming up through the floor to
the TV. Such a project needs to meet full 100% WAF qualifications (Wife
Acceptance Factor).  
</br>  
</br>Since I can't tax dodge a lappy until July I thought I'd get a head
start on the Myth box. I bought a Dvico FusionHDTV Home single tuner
card which has a BT878 chipset. It was mostly detected by 'bunty and
after reminding it to load a couple more modules it was up and running
in no time. Ubuntu Myth packages made the install almost completely
painless. I've even got the included remote control working too.  
</br>  
</br>MythTV is an awesome piece of software. It downloads program guide
data, has fantastic recording options ensuring you never miss a
particular show plus it's the only PVR software to include commercial
ripping. Is this the saviour of Australia TV?
