\>Oh the joy of a non-updated blog.

While the outlaws were visiting over July time I exploited the presence
of 2 larger males in the group as a reason to wheeling. We met up with a
ragtag log from the Outerlimits4x4 forum and off we went into the bush
at the Glasshouse Mountains. This is an area the zook club go to quite
often but somehow I've never got there. The trouble with going with the
Outerlimits crew is since it's not an official club the trip is lacking
a certain feeling of safety and responsibility. Everyone is friendly and
fun loving but I'm uncertain what would happen if big important bits
started falling off your car and you needed to rely on them. Zook club
members would be all over a broken rig no problems but with unofficial
groups I'm not so sure.

We had 3 Sierras, a Vitara, a Maverick (Patrol), a Landcruiser and at 30
year old F100. Steers like an oil tanker and weighed about the same.
Glasshouse has some excellent hill climbs and we even found some mud
holes to get stuck in. A much smaller area than Mount Mee where I'd been
previously and easier to find some ridiculous hills to get stuck on.

I got bogged in a mud hole once and had to get pulled out. I've since
changed the leads and plugs so hopefully this sorta thing will happen
less often. I also got stuck on my tail on a slope with no way to roll
backwards and couldn't start the car.

Carnage: Bent exhaust into mudflap. Melted mudflap now gone. Swapped
paint with a rock while bashing front right wheel flare. I've just
sprayed over it and will try and get new flares later (sssh, don't tell
the handbrake :) )

Here's some vids.
