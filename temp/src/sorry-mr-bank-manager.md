...but I had to do it. While I have cash in the bank I decided to buy
another car. We've up/downgraded to a 1999 Pajero (Shogun to old world
folks). Its got real low mileage and its real clean for an 8 year old
car. It does however, have a heart breaking 3.5ltr petrol donk in it.
The reasoning is that in order to go camping we need more space. Baby +
Car seat + Camping gear does not in any way equal a Grande Vitara so it
has to go and I owe nature a slice of my soul when I die. :) Anyone want
a 2003 GV?
