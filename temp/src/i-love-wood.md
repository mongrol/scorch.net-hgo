... and just look at how much of it I've bought.

Yep, a little over a year and 2 months after getting plans drawn up
we've finally got movement on the Kitten Ranch Expansion Project (KREP).
We've got wood, steel beams, some concrete sheeting and a big feck off
rusty builders trailer full of hidden secrets and black mojo. Rumour has
it there's some builders showing up at some point tomorrow to start
dismantling the rear deck. Yeah right!
