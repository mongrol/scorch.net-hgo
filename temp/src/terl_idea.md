Just had a game idea. Let's write and talk at the same time!

I've been playing Shadowrun Returns. Love the graphics, love the simplified
action points, love the cover system. Don't like that the game is on rails
so much. What if we had a vertically scrolling roguelike? The Traction Edge
has occurred. It creeps up from the bottom of the screen and if it reaches 
our intrepid policeman it's all over. He is absorbed into the mechanical 
singularity. So he must run north, up the map. Along the way, he encounters
mechs attacking him which he can either run past, or destroy.

Terrain
===

Mostly above ground to give movement. Trees, villages. A similar cover system
to shadowrun and which I also had in TractionEdge should be used. Tunnel
systems could be used sparingly, canyons, tight areas introduces tension points
(hmm, which lens is that?). Let's make it continuous. There's no levels. You're
constantly on the run until you reach the end of the game. This would need
some fancy procedural generation nonsense indeed.

Turns
===

Roguelikes are usually single turn based. A player turn is a visible unit. Monsters
either have turns faster or slower than the player. In this we could use the two
turn method of Shadowrun Returns. This allows for fast play with a single player
while also giving the effect of a turn based action point game. More accessible.

Progression
===

Not sure about this. I'd like to avoid the traditional XP raising, get points to spend
style system and think up something simpler.

That'll do for now.
