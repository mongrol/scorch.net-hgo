\>Time these days is weird. Time used to work like this. You would do
stuff, then do more stuff, then even more stuff then say something like
"geez where has the last year went" or "remember that stuff we done?
That was five years ago what happened?". This is because in general
every day terms not a lot changes that fast. You age so slowly you don't
notice it until you try and do Kung Fu.

Nowadays though, I have a new barometer of time. Young Coop changes
rapidly. Every day he's doing something new, or getting visibly bigger.
Every week he loses another set of clothes or outgrows a hat. Actually
we've never had a hat to fit him ever, we simply can't get ahead of the
curve on that one no matter how quickly we buy hats. Buy a hat that
fits, great. Get around to using it a week later and it pings off his
head. He's the AntiHat[tm].

This daily change has the effect of enforcing the passage of time,
shoving it in our faces and make us feel just how important every day
is. I feel literally dragged along through time with so much less focus
on the future or the past. For a Buddhist this is great.

Cooper is 3 months old next week but it seems like he's been here for
longer. Days start early at 4.45am, lunch is at 10am and we're ready for
bed at teatime. Somehow there's no time during the day to actually do
anything that doesn't involve child rearing.

We wouldn't change it for the world though. He's also taught us just how
creepy parents can be. We'll sneak into his room 2 or 3 times an evening
and just stand and stare at him without waking him up. I believe all
parents do this. I'm gonna pull mine up about that.
