I'd collected a couple of portable telly's to use in my mame cab. The
picture quality with Black Tiger running is outstanding. Just like a
mini arcade machine. However, some inquiries how I might utilise the
power inside the telly has warned me off of using a CRT. Telly's are
inheritantly dangerous beasts and I'd underestimated just how dodgy they
can be. Since I'm not a CRT repair man and I'm probably going to be
inside this box quite a lot (and I have kids who quite like their dada)
I'm going to compromise and stick to an LCD.

Perfection may not be achieved but at least I'll be around to see the
project finished. I do have an old 17" LCD lying around but I think it's
a little too big. I'll wait till I do my Blender mockup and get some
proper sizing around the joystick panel before I decide.
