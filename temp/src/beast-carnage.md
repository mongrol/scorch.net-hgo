Gran and Grandpa Skreeg were over visiting during the last month. I
thought it would be nice to take Grandpa Skreeg out "wheeling" in The
Beast[tm], a 1992 Suzuki Sierra. It's pretty much stock with only a body
lift and 29" tyres on it but I love it to bits. It's good fun. Anyway,
ol Papa Skreeg used to do a bit of rally driving in his younger years
and spent most of life hotting up cars in some form or another so you'd
think he would be able to pick a line in a 4wd travelling at less than
walking speed. Think again!

The end result on that little tumble was a bent door and windowscreen
frame both of which are getting a little tricky to get a hold of these
days. 800 bucks later and we're back on the road. Good job too, I have
more of this to do.
