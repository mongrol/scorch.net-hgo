If you were a C64 head back in the eighties you might have played a game
called Cauldron, or Cauldron II. This was released by Ocean software and
of course had the invincible Martin Galway providing the music. Looks
like some mad germans have done a live on stage remix of the music from
the sequel. Awesome!
