I suffer from General Anxiety Disorder and the last few months have been a
downhill spiral with the last few weeks being the worst I've ever experienced
due to a switch of SRRI's. In the evening's I"ve been utterly unable to 
contribute to any project beyond the slightest triviality. This week however,
the new drugs are kicking in and I'm feeling up. Time to get back on the horse
and get stuff done.

I've been trying to learn python and have started Traction Edge RL for this
purpose. It's not going very fast and it benefits noone but myself so I'll get on
with some community projects instead.

1. Finish Debian Love packing Policy.
2. Research and polish Libreplanet's guide on Open Smartphones.
3. Research and polish Libreplanet's guide on Single Board Computers.
4. Debian Games Team bugfixing.

A nice easy start.

Then we have some other tasks that have been on the backburner

1. Article on Buddhism and Free Software
2. TractionEdgeRL
