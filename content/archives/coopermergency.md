\>Lille Cooperman was rushed into the hozzie last friday morning. Some
violent vomiting followed by going limp and extremely white prompted us
to get an ambulance pronto. 3 hours and an ultrasound later confirmed it
as an.... wait for it..... intersusection of the bowel. Yeah I know, wtf
is that you say? Its when the bowel, not being the brightest organ in
the trunk decides to push itself into itself telescopic style. This is
very painful and dangerous for lille coopermen as it cuts off blood
supply and can go necrotic.

The solution to this is to place your baby on a realtime X-Ray table,
shove a hose up his arse and blow air into his gut. This makes his gut
balloon and pop back into the correct place (hopefully). There's a 95%
chance of success and a small risk of perforation of the gut. The other
option is an operation so no thanks, the tube it is. So the wee man
proudly done the biggest fart of his short life and probably the biggest
one he'll do for the next 40 years.

2 days later and it's like it never happened. He's a very happy child.
Recently learnt to roll over and get stuck on his stomach. He can
balance sitting up fairly well and loves carrot! Even though he won't
consciously remember anything of this weekend I'm sure it must have some
affect on him. Every input coaxes and prods the brains development in
certain directions. We sub-consciously, in some alien manner remember
everything we ever experience. Perhaps he'll develop a hose allergy.
