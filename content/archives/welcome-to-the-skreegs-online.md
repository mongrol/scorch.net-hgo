It seems this internet thing is quite popular and I see lots of people
like to write blog thingies about their lives so other folk can see how
much more dull there's is in comparison. In an effort to make ours less
dull I've decided to start writing a blog thingy myself. Hey, I've only
written a couple of sentences and I can feel my life becoming more
interesting already. It really works!

Ok, the real reason is all about Miniskreeg. Spawn of my loins is
currently baking at body temperature and the timers set for the 8th of
September. This is quite obviously a life changing event for all of us
(especially the kid) and I thought it'd be a good idea to get a blog
together to record the experience for you "folks back home".
