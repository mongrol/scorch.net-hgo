Traction Edge is now officially over at [Sourceforge][]. I'm quite happy
with this as Sourceforge's kit is a level up from Googlecodes in terms
of functions. I now get to make a pretty website for TE.

I've also made inroads into self hosting but it takes some work. My
initial plan is to replace Google Reader with [Tiny Tiny RSS][]. Apache
though, if you haven't done much work with it, takes a bit of kicking to
get into shape. I already host a few internal webs (Mythweb, Squeezebox,
etc) and need to ensure its all secure before I go poking holes to the
outside. I also don't like my server running mythbuntu but that can't be
helped. Debian doesn't have MythTV packages yet.

Hopefully this week I can dump Google Reader which then only leaves
Youtube to be replaced. My current thinking is to either move this blog
to Freedom Cottage entirely and host the vids using a video gallery
plugin or similar, or just the vids. I can then lock them up and dish
out logins to family etc.

In other news it's good to see the [FreedomBox Foundation][] get there
kickstarter funding in good time. Look's like a great project hopefully
getting some momentum into non-cloud solutions.
