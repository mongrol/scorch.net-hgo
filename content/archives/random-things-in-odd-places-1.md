A great thing about having kids is constantly finding random objects
sitting in places they shouldn't be and since we're always busy doing
more important things these objects will sometimes sit in their place
for days or weeks on end before someone can be bothered moving them.  
I kept meaning to start a series of Random Thing in Odd Places. So
here's \#1. It's a harmonica, in it's case sitting on the shelf above
the toilet. It used to sit on the sink next to the toothbrushes for
several days until someone moved it up here. It looks quite comfy where
it is and may be handy if you want a toot while you scoot. :)
