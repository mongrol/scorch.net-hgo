Well that didn't last long. 4 weeks after returning to Kung Fu I've quit
it for good. While I'd been pleased with the initial sessions after a
few weeks the training took it's toll on my joints which gradually
increased in discomfort and started getting quite sore. Couple that with
the stage of training which involves lots of jump kicks it it became
quite clear I couldn't sustain it.

So since then I've been cycling to work to keep my fitness up but now
I've found even that difficult. Any attempt at putting power down
through my knees results shows up an inherent weakness. It's like when
you lack in energy and need a Boost bar or something, only it's just at
the top of my knees. The muscles just don't respond like they should. So
I'm giving up the bike as well. It's just too uncomfortable.

Can't run, can't jump and now can't cycle. What can I do?
