I'm now starting to implement the savegame feature in Traction Edge. A
worthwhile and necessary task that's sure to propel it into the annals
of gaming history. It's incredibly tedious though. I'm using TinyXML so
that's the file IO burden removed but trawling through all the objects
needing to be saved out is already irritating me and I've only been at
it for an hour.

Still, it can't all be glamourous coding of AI and accidentally
asymmetric field of view algorithms can it?
