I thought I'd write this down so I don't forget when it happened. After
a lapse of nearly 2 1/2 years which has seen me visit various
specialists, had numerous scans and a double hip arthroscope, I returned
to Kung Fu training last night. The session went well but I expected the
worst today since I did have quite sore hip joints. Today though I only
have normal muscle soreness from training and no joint pain whatsoever.
W00t! I feel my awesomeness returning!
