The 13 week scan was over a month ago now but no less a significant
event now than it was then. I've always looked at pictures of other
peoples scans with almost complete disinterest. A static photo just
simply doesn't do the event justice. The image is basically a real time
"slice" of the baby and surrounding paraphernalia. Each frame taken by
itself looks like a mess but with the doctor moving the "camera" back
and forth the image constantly changes. Your brain magically joins all
the images together in your head and you end up with a fairly clear idea
that you're looking at a tiny miniature human being inside the torso of
your spouse.

We weren't quite prepared for this. The doctor doesn't exactly set the
scene or give any warning. One minute there's nothing then wham! There's
the baby! Legs stretched out, little brain, organs, ribs, spine, fingers
and... it's alive! It moves! In fact, it wouldn't stay still and it took
the doc some time to get a clear enough view to take the NT scan. We
were both very surprised at how mobile it was. Legs and arms kicking,
jaw going up and down like it's chewing gum. Amazing stuff and just to
join the hordes of almost intelligible pictures of 13 week scans on the
net. Here's Miniskreeg.

Look Mom! I'm on t'Internet!
