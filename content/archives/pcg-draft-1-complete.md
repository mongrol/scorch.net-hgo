PCG is up to a state now that I can move on a bit. Currently I have one
scenario, the farm. 2 sizes of construction, random trees and a dirst
road. The trees and road I'm not happy with but it'll do just now.  
  
I now need to figure out how progression works. Static content needs to
be removed just niw then slotted in somehow later. It's working out how
the game scales the difficulty.   
  
And when are you going to fix those bloody doors?
