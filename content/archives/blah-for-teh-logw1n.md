I've now ripped through all the code and replaced any output with
[blah][]. This is an awesome little C++ logger library and has
completely solved all my debug woes, std::cout spam and my poor effort
at a logger. Who wants to write a perfect logger? Not me, I'd rather
write game code.

Next up, I think I'll move the level population data out into xml files.
