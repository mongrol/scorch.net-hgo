\>Yay! Today the bell finally when on the Oven of Sprogzilla. MiniSkreeg
is now 37 weeks and full term. Come out and tidy your room! We're
basically just waiting now. Everything is prepared, room ready, little
socks ironed, hospital bags packed. All we need now is a good ol' flex
of the uterus.

I suppose I should write something about how I feel coming up to this
life changing event but I find the gestation process, and the
preparation work you do during it has taken so long that it's kinda
taken away some of the impact. It's not like one minute we're coasting
along doing normal Oz things then bam there's a kid. The whole 9 months
has been talking about it, buying stuff, reading about it, going to
classes etc... We've been becoming parents gradually all the time.

Let's be real here though, it's still going to be BAM there's a kid to
look after but I feel that we're ready for it. Nerves? pfft!
