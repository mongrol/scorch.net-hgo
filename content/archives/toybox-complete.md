Actually its been complete for a while but I'm just slow at getting
pictures online. It's turned out great for something made out of scrap
wood by an IT bloke who knows nothing about wood (I love wood).
Everything a toddler could ask for. Nice bright paint, heavy duty
varnish and a chain to trap the fingers when gravity and the lid
conspire against him (again).
