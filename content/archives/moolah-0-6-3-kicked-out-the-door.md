\>It's quite alarming that the more I hack on moolah the more bugs I
find and probably the more I introduce. I'm just not paying attention
and applying the correct gumption in learning to code tightly and more
professionally. My coding time is so limited that it always boils down
to be a case of 'get it in, ooh it works, let's not bother tidying it
up, right what's next?'

This is probably a very common problem among us amateur programmers and
very likely not one that's going to be fixed. Moolah is my first cocoa
application ever. It's fairly complicated under the hood as it's
handling normal data in a fairly abnormal fashion (envelope budgeting)
but trying to fit within the standard accounting practises. It does work
well, and it is getting more stable so I'm quite happy to bang along
adding more functionality and frequently embarrassing myself when I look
back at old code.

Next on the list is a search filter, more interface polishing and then
onto reports.
