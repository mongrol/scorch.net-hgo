So where are a month after my tirade against the oppression of freedom
and liberty?

Macbook Pro has been sold. They hold their value quite well and the
money from it (a 4 year old machine) paid for the build of my new Debian
desktop plus some left over. That, plus the cash from my HTC Desire
leaves me some \$500 in profit from this venture.

Debian and the WAF. Photo management is lacking in linux. Even the
latest Shotwell just doesn't have a decent enough feature set to
completely satisfy the missus or me for that matter. Workflow for
mailing photos is just rubbish. Editing tools are poor meaning I need to
export to Fotoxx which is ok for me, but no use for her. Still, we make
compromises and get on with it.

Youtube has been the biggest headache to replace. Attempts at self
hosting family videos have failed. It's just too slow to serve 20MB
files at 64kbps upstream so I've now invested in a cheapie VPS which
gives me 1Mbps instead and I'll probably knock up a simple streaming
webapp to serve them. The next challenge is to find the balance between
a completely free code (ogg/theora) and something that the folks back
home can play without hassle (probably h264/mkv).

I still have a bothersome requirement of keeping Windows on my Netbook
around purely for the need to restore Hazel's iPod every time Linux
stuffs it up.

I've also now got a lot more maintenance to do. The mythbox now does
backup and hosts webapps. I have a vps to backup and keep secure and a
debian box that tempts me to fiddle with all the time.
