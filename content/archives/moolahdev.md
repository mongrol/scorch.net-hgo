\>One thing I've noticed when reading a lot of dev blogs is that people
get burnt out and take a break. I've just hit the same thing and now
realise why. I was on a coding splurge, believing I was close to getting
moolah to a point where I could run it "in production" with my own
accounts. Some odd things started happening and I realised a whole chunk
of calculating code is all wrong and does exactly what a frog does when
trying to get to the other side a river with a jumping strategy that
involves each new jump being exactly half the distance of the last one.
I'm not going to be filling many envelopes with that one. I'm now on a
couple of weeks break from it. I'll ponder and muse occasionally on my
code conundrum.

I'm also gaining more respect for the authors of current envelope
programs out there. What initially appears a simple and earnest task is
actually a lot more complicated than I first thought. It's easy making
an envelope budgeting but its damn hard keeping it simple.
