We're getting close to the next release. We now have skill point
upgrades between levels and modified melee damage to be dependent on
strength hopefully encouraging players to build tank style squaddies.

What's left before the next release? Not a lot.

-   Level up with XP gain. Every level grants you a point to spend on
    attributes.
-   Better tuning of the mobs delivered with each level. I just flung
    some crap code in the populate levels. It needs much better code
    with some random hardness thrown in.

That's it. I sense a release within a couple of a week.
