So now I've got XP progression in and had a good play testing session.
The result.

-   It's beatable until the Gimps on level 3 appear.
-   Path finding sucks. Monsters still get stuck at map edges
-   AI needs obvious real work
-   XP gain grants too many skill points.

Â I only have 2 AI models, 1 melee and 1 ranged. The ranged one is a real
challenge while the gimps can one shot your soldiers. The first obvious
thing to fix is pathfinding so my next challenge is to get some real A\*
pathfinding in before fleshing out the AI's. I do remember I was going
to look at Djikstra maps which can also serve other AI behaviours.
