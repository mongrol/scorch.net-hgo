Got my sticks today. I went for the reputable Sanwa variety. They feel
of hardcore arcade greatness. A nice selection buttons too. Can't do
anything with them though till I get my Ultimarc mini-pac which was just
ordered from the US.

On the software side I have advancemame running reasonably well with the
Pi clocked up to 900Mhz. It plays Greenberet, Black Tiger etc at full
speed which makes me well happy. I'll finish Black Tiger yet, oh yes.

I've also got advancemenu compiled and launching apps fine so that's
basically the mame stuff sorted.
