\>Well ok, not quite overboard but at very least we've left the marina.
After a lovely hiatus of drinking cheap wine, eating biscuits and
playing Mass Effect I've picked up moolah dev again. It always gets a
bit slow when something I'm writing reaches a functional level that I'm
happy with myself but I've reached a point now where certain things are
pissing even me off. Like the disorderly budget window, the slow
transaction updates, the crash if you click save too quick and the
complete lack of reporting and search functions. So, in no certain order
the following iteems shall be tackled;

<div>
-   Save last accounts selected in import and budget windows. Document
    prefs!
-   Sort that bloody menu bar out, it's a disgrace.
-   Finished the Getting Started wiki as more people are downloading it
    and probably feeling a bit negative about the experience.
-   Search function! Get a scope bar in there. Yeah baby!
-   Reports. The biggy. I already have this designed in my head. Should
    be fun.

<div>
Still enjoying coding and I shouldn't leave it too long again. Today I
had to stare at some code for about 3 minutes to find a syntax error. :)
