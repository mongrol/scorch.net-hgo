\>A few weeks ago I knocked out the first release of moolah. This, being
0.5 and pretty rough, was done under the "release early, release often"
advice that google and many other Open Source developers preach. Does
this really hold for a Mac app though? In general, Mac users aren't used
to unfinished, unpolished, buggy apps. They're a bit "ordinary" (I
suppose you could almost say snobby) in that they like they're apps to
be v1.0 at least, nicely polished, and without bugs.

Luckily, only 3 people have downloaded it and I've seen no mention of it
anywhere else so word isn't getting out there and that's just how I like
it. Developing this as OSS is a bit odd. The program is being written
with my own personal requirements in mind, while at the same time
keeping the code, interface and workflow generic enough to suit everyone
else. It's an interesting challenge and one I'm sure lots of indie
developers face when they start off.

v0.6 if now released. I've tidied up the UI so it looks more final.
Added more functionality, again based on what I want in the app and
squashed bugs. Bugs, bugs bugs! I find them all the time but they're
always easy and fun to fix.Â In fact, coding the entire thing has been a
joy so far. The frameworks, Objective-C, Xcode is all a breeze to use.
Just like the Mac in general.
