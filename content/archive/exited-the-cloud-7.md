I'm about 90% towards where I wanted to be which is pretty good. Let's
see the score card.

**Cloud**

-   GMail

Replaced by Fastmail.fm. This is still cloud side but self hosting email
is a nasty business. My self hosting platform is still immature. I do
have a self hosted roundcube though for accessing it from anywhere
(work).

-   Google Reader

Replaced by self hosted Tiny Tiny RSS. Works really well.

-   Google Code

Traction Edge has been moved to Sourceforge and will no longer be
developed for Mac and Windows. Open platforms only for my creations.
This also means Moolah has been abandoned and the source is offline.

-   YouTube

No replacement as yet. The videos have been taken down and I'll probably
use a self hosted clip-bucket.

-   Android Phone

Sold! Glad to be back to the peace and quiet of a stupid phone.
Smartphones are like television. They stop people thinking.

All this means I can close my Google account. Which I've done. Yay!

-   Social Networking

I still have an identica account which I never use. This one needs a lot
more thought. Social sites are very good for information spread. We just
need to ensure that those in control are at least responsible but we're
much better off with a decentralised system. One day.

**Mac**

Debian Squeeze PC bought and built. It's also passed preliminary Wife
Acceptance!

-   iPhoto

This tragedy of an application (iLife 11 is guff) is replaced by
Shotwell v8 from unstable. It's simple and functional. For editing I use
Fotoxx. A very comprehensive editor with a small footprint.

-   iMovie

Kino does the job here. The new PC has firewire on board is no hassles.

-   iDVD

Bombono. Still to really try this but it looks functional. iDVD was a
train wreck anyway.

-   Video Conferencing

Alas I'm still stuck with Skype. This currently the only non open source
package on this system. Even my gfx drivers are open source.

**Conclusion**

A good result. It's taken a couple of months of shuffling things around,
researching, buying and building but I'm now a lot more ethically
responsible than I was before. I count myself lucky (again) that I have
the technical know how to run a Free system at home and to make a
contribution to the freedom of people everywhere.
