Blog
====

In an effort to increase my geekdom I've moved my blog over to [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) and AWS S3. I don't have anything against cloud hosting for information that is deemed publically available and I need to learn AWS for work. My VIP is also slowing down the past few months so it's time for it to go.

Hosting
===

At home I have a PC acting as a server. It's a Sempron with 4GB of ram. It hosts Transmission and a VM running Mythtv Backend. Myth is the only reason I have a server at home pulling 30-50W's. I've ordered a [Cubietruck](http://www.cubieboard.org) to host the Myth Backend instead. I don't need grunt for transcoding, only 1GB ethernet and SATA. The Cubietruck is the first dual core ARM board to come out under $100 with both of these. I can then close my server and run Myth with 5W instead.

I have a VIP running tt-rss and roundcube. The plan is to close this security nightmare and move these services back in house running on a Raspberrypi. I'll then have all my services running on less than 10W.
