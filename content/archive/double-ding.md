\>Due date today. Last 24 hours Hazel's been having slight painful
contractions randomly between 14 and 30 minutes. Still can't be called
the start of labour but it does make me think somethings gonna happen in
the next couple of days. Let's take a guess at a hospital visit Monday
morning. Let's say I have to go to work on Monday morning then have to
come home again as soon as I get there.

In other news Hazel's just lost a bit of a tooth. Luckily I have a long
experience with dentists, fillings as well as bits of tooth falling out
my mouth so I can able to provide adequate consolation. I feel for her
though. As someone who's ignored dentists all her life but still had
relatively healthy teeth she's not going to enjoy next week.

That'll be 2 sore orificies!
