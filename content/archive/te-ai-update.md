My Dijkstra implementation is now in and providing some lovely
pathfinding indeed. I'm now finishing up initial desires and getting
monsters to flee appropriately. I'm sure my handling of the various DJ
maps isn't very efficient. After this is done I'll move onto something
else as it's taken a few months to get it done (kids, work, the usual
mental issues haven't left much time).

I'll have this out for ARRP 2012 then we'll move into the tech tree
area.
