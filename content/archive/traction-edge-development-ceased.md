Unfortunately TE development is now over and probably never to restart.
Basically after 3 years of work I still have only a small game to show.
My limited time doesn't leave much space to make the game I envisage.
C++ development is slow with a lot of my time fighting my existing code
base and the stuff I've just rushed in. It's become too painful.

I've also realised that my vision isn't fully formed. Couple that with
slow development and it's onto a loser. When your game mechanics aren't
complete then you can find yourself coding for a month then having to
scrap or rewrite large chunks.

I've now started looking at Lua and [Love2d][]Â for my next projects. It
appears to allow much more rapid development. TE may arrive in a newer
form at some point as its still a game I want to make.
