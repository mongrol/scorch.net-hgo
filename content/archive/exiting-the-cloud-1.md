So the Exit The Cloud/Be A Bolshy Arse strategy is underway.

Let's see how we're doing so far.

**Apple**

My home PC is a Macbook Pro. I need to install and use Linux on it
instead.

-   <span style="color:#339966;">Debian Squeeze is (probably) released
    next week. I'll assess that then.</span>

**Social Networking**

I have an identi.ca and ~~twitter~~ account. Noone uses Identi.ca and
I’ve only started using Twitter since the floods. I can easily cancel
both accounts.

-   <span style="color:#339966;">Twitter account deleted. Identi.ca
    remains as I get a feel for the risk.</span>

**Google**

1.  ~~GMail~~ - Replaced by Fastmail. Hosting completely out of the
    cloud is beyond my time at the moment. The GMail account has been
    completely deleted but no doubt Google has already had their metrics
    from all my emails.
2.  Calendar - All events deleted. Failed to delete completely.
3.  Android Phone (Market, Checkout etc)
4.  Maps
5.  Navigation
6.  GoogleCode (for Traction Edge and Moolah) - Will move to sourceforge
7.  Search

1.  ~~Blogger~~ - Redirect sent to Wordpress.
2.  \<lots more I don’t realise\>

So we're doing quite well. It will be interesting to see how much falls
over now I've removed the GMail account and also how far I can push for
separation between Google and my Android phone.

In other news I've removed a dependancy at work by replacing One Note
with Emacs [Orgmode][] and an excellent Open Source screenshot app
called [Greenshot][]. Radical or what?
