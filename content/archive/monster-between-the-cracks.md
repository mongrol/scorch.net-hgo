The process of switching from one SRRI to another is quite simple. You cut down a bit on the one
you're taking for a few days then switch over to the other, ramping up over the next couple of 
weeks. This process can be quite unpleasant however, the very reason you're doing it is because
you're having quite an unpleasant time anyway. So it should just be a case of riding it out till the
your new favourite drug kicks in.

Not so.

I was on 100mg of Praxitine. The last week of taking it was the worst I've probably ever had but 
on the first day of dropping to 50mg I started to feel better. Calmer. I could still feel the rumblings
deep down in my wires but generally I was happier and able to hold a reasonable social
engagement with other living beings. 3 days later I'd dropped them completely and started on 
Elev (the proper name will come to me in by the next post). 50mg for a week then double it.

All good for 5 days, feel better every day then woosh, down back into the doldrums for 2 days.
Not quite as bad as before but the speed at which my mood dropped last Sunday afternoon was
quite scary. As was the accompanying thoughts. Monday seen the boost to 100mg and I'm now
back on an even keel. Best I've been for a few months.

It's very difficult to see what's working and what's not. The last 3 months have seen me good for
5 days then 2 shocking ones. I now try and get as much quality time in with my kids as I can 
when I'm good as I know when I'm bad, I retreat from them. The random babble and constant
attention seeking is too much for me.

Amazingly I managed to play [Kerbal Space Program](http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com) for
nearly 2 hours last night, calmly and without context switch, getting distracted, chasing squirrels.
