XP gain is now in. There's a rough curve that'll need tuning as we go
but now after a map your patrolmen will have attribute points to spend
on level up.

I hate UI programming. It's just painful and timeconsuming. I first had
a go at doing some window,view, object type framework ages ago which I
abandoned due to inexperience. I now hard code it all into screens. My
next game will have a proper framework, or most likely, use a 3rd party
UI lib.
