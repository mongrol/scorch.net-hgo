I've been an anxiety sufferer for nearly 2 decades. The worst of which have been the last 
3 months. Imagine every nerve in your body activated, ready to spring into action, heart
speeded up, an increased sensitivity to everything happening in you body. Imagine being
in this state from waking to bedtime, then all day the next day, the day after that. That's
how I currently live.

My condition has taken different shapes over the years. First it was then undiagnosed
panic attacks and an odd seizure while driving down the A70. We quickly found that
the SSRI citalopram helped. It was effective when I needed it over the last 2 decades.
A year ago I found my stress and anxiety was getting worse. Citalopram no longer worked
We changed to Escetalopram, a variant, and got me back calm again. However, 6 months
ago my anxiety was rising. Small things would irritate me. I'd feel like having a good cry
and had to "escape" family situations more often. We tried increasing the dose until Xmas
when I decided to switch doctors. 

The new doctor suggests Proxatrine. It goes well for a month. Well, better than the week
of going dry while it kicked in, during which I was basically homicidal.

I'm not stressed about anything at all. I don't worry about things. Work is secure, money
is ok, family is great. With the help of Buddhism I've even came to terms with the nature
of my own existence so that no longer stresses me either and I'm reasonobly comfortable
with Emacs! The disorder appears to be entirely biological.

The 3 weeks has seen the effects of Proxatrine wear off. The last week I've been entirely
on fire every waking moment. I wake up. My nerves are "activated" like I've just been
jumped by a bunch of ninjas. While in this state it's almost impossible to focus on any
one thing for longer than 30 seconds. My work doesn't suffer too badly since I tend to
work on 10-15 things at once anyway. I just don't usually context switch like a squirrel
after a 500ml can of Mother. At the end of the day I'm knackered, feeling like I've ran
a half marathon. I get home, greet my children who want me to play, then collapse on 
the bed. After a failed attempt at relaxing I start drinking till bedtime.

We now switch drugs to another and keep going until we either find one that works or we
run out of options. I'm not sure what happens then.
