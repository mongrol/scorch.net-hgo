The last two weeks have been pretty hard for me as an anxiety sufferer
so practically no devving has been done at all. Anxiety makes you reach
for escape and distraction and this came in the form of a nearly new
Nokia N900. The ultimate geeks phone. :)

Back on TE now I'm working on adding item handling functionality. I want
to drop, pickup and possibly pass items around. This also makes me think
of progression in terms of how we gain new items. A tech tree is the
ultimate aim but with dev going so slowly I want TE to remain fairly
playable as I iterate forward. Since mobs are going to be dropping weird
weapons (e.g. Brass Fangs) some requirement should be implemented to use
it. Or perhaps it needs to be held by someone with high intelligence in
order to identify it properly and reveal what skill it needs. After that
anyway can use it.
