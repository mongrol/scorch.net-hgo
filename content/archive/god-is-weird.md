\>After the emergence of Sprogzilla I've gave a bit of thought towards
[Intelligent Design][]. The extremes of the birthing process, from the
pain of delivery to the love of the result, seems too freakish to be the
product of just random evolution.

Another factor lending credence to this theory is one of limbs. We've
discovered that the average parent requires a minimum of three arms to
successfully administer to the needs of a baby. Said baby, who in
reality appears to have only two arms, constantly feel like they have at
least four.
