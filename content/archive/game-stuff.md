Firstly I just watched the talk by Icculus at Flourish 2012. Very good
talk and a great overview of all the useful tools the open source
community provides for game programmers. Picked up a few myself
including Valgrind and I'm even more interested in Lua that I was before
thought I don't think I'm quite ready yet to incorporate scripting.
Video is [here][]. Tis very good.

I've also started on TE's AI refresh. I'm moving to Dijkstra maps and a
behavioural model and getting rid of the horrid inflexible and coding
nightmare of a state machine I've put in. I'm pretty excited about this.
I've already got pathfinding running straight and true. Slightly
troubled about how I get terrain costs into it but I'm sure some Shiraz
and thoughtful sleeps will iron that one out.

Inspiration for Dijkstra maps came from Brian Walkers excellent
[article][] on roguebasin.
