      <description>My second iteration of TE&amp;rsquo;s AI has finally reached some kind of stability. It&amp;rsquo;s the first draft of a fairly basic state machine with a few bits of bandaid over my rushed code.
The FSM consists of Patrol state, Attack State and Run State. Each state, during update will run an awareness update (process fov) then make some decisions based on what it can see and also what the creatures present condition is.</description>

      <title>Exiting The Cloud #5</title>

      <description>Traction Edge is now officially over at Sourceforge. I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with this as Sourceforge&amp;rsquo;s kit is a level up from Googlecodes in terms of functions. I now get to make a pretty website for TE.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also made inroads into self hosting but it takes some work. My initial plan is to replace Google Reader with Tiny Tiny RSS. Apache though, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t done much work with it, takes a bit of kicking to get into shape.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been angling towards self hosting over the last couple of days. Firstly I just shrugged off the idea as being too much hassle, possibly costly, difficult to maintain etc. The more I thought about it the more I warmed to it though. I mean, all I need to do is poke some holes for what I need (www only really) and make sure I have a proper backup. I&amp;rsquo;d start off with SVN, move this blog there, integrated some video streaming plugin for the clan to what kidlet videos and then think about tackling mail.</description>
