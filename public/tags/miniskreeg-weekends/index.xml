      <description>&amp;gt;This weekend we went camping for the first time since The Miniskreeg showed up. I have a camping checklist and it now has a &amp;ldquo;Cooper&amp;rdquo; section in it with unforgettable items like dummies, portacots and ehgoo&amp;rsquo;s. Camping always has something missing but the impact of forgetting the unforgettable when there&amp;rsquo;s a baby involved is a magnitute greater than normal. Luckily, all we forgot was good weather, which was both a blessing and a curse.</description>

      <description>&amp;gt;The trick to a happy evening is to tire the child out during the day. Keeping him &amp;ldquo;cooped&amp;rdquo; up in the house drives everyone nuts so at weekends we like to get out places. Cooper loves pools, water, skiddling, anything wet related. Sunday we took him up to the Redcliffe lagoon which is a nice pool area beside the seaside. This kid is going to be swimming unaided before he&amp;rsquo;s 3 I reckon.</description>
