      <description>&amp;gt;Bubzilla #2 arrived yesterday 31st December 2009 at 5.17pm with no drama at all. Hazel had some &amp;ldquo;stomach pains&amp;rdquo; overnight which developed into minor contractions in the morning. After all the chaos of Cooper&amp;rsquo;s birth we were reluctant to even phone in, only to be sent home again. However, they were fairly regular and speeding up fast. 15 mins apart at 9am then 10mins apart at 1pm. We phoned in, Cooper was at daycare and in we went with bags packed.</description>
