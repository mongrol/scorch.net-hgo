      <description>.. I just go, icky ficky ficky!
It&amp;rsquo;s all getting a bit out of control. The mythtv box, which I&amp;rsquo;m now running tt-rss and roundcube on frequently crashes running out of memory. Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s only ever had 1 GB of ram in it which is pretty good going for a combined back/frontend. I&amp;rsquo;ve had to disable apache to keep the WAF. I&amp;rsquo;ve ordered a Zotac ND22 for a frontend from PriceUSA (about $300 delivered) and it&amp;rsquo;s on its way.</description>

      <description>&amp;gt;For some reason I never got around to writing about this before. Some months ago I decided to get into Mac software development but being a jaded gamer that can&amp;rsquo;t see to stay on the wagon I was addicted to a game called Incursion-Roguelike. Incursion is a classic roguelike in the same vein as the famous Nethack and Adom but uses the D20 ruleset from Wizards of the Coast. Think a Nethack version of Neverwinter Nights and you have it.</description>

      <description>&amp;gt;For some bizarre reason I decided to spend the entire week free of gadgets. No mobile phone, no mp3 player, no nintendo DS and no computer at home for 7 days. Is this actually possible for a Type A personality that&amp;rsquo;s been gaming since 1982? No it&amp;rsquo;s not.
Last Sunday went ok. I got on with some DIY, dug a hole, found a pipe, broke a pipe, fixed a pipe then realised the pipe was in the wrong place so it was no use to me anyway.</description>
