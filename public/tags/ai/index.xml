      <description>I had the appraise skill in and about to start using it when I realised I didn&amp;rsquo;t need it. What is an appraise skill anyway? It&amp;rsquo;s based on intelligence and lets you identify creatures and objects but you can&amp;rsquo;t raise it with skill points. This means UI work to avoid those untrainable skills in the list. I then reassessed why I had this skill? To test if creatures can identify other creatures and objects?</description>

      <description>Fleeing monsters are now in, they do tend to do a bit of pillar dancing in and out of FOV but I&amp;rsquo;ll fix that later. Next up though I want to get some individuality in and we can do that with the flee desire. I want monsters to have different flee characteristics.
Mindless creatures, spiders, slithers to some degree should only flee at the last resort. Larger ones should exhibit more intelligence and there lies the balancing act.</description>
