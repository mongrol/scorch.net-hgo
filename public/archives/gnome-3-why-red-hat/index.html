      <p>Lots has been written on GNOME3 already so I&rsquo;ll make this quick
(probably not). Let&rsquo;s start with some facts.</p>
<ul>
<li> GNOME2 was the primary desktop of Linux and the majority of
Distributions. It is after all considered GNU software.</li>
<li>GNOME is driven by Red Hat as they pay the wages of the main
developers.</li>
<li>Red Hat sells server software.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s a conundrum or two there. Consumer devices are rushing towards
tablets and the main players, Apple, Microsoft, Google and to a lesser
extent Ubuntu and a bunch of Android resellers, are following them as
expected.</p>
<p>Consumers use tablets as very simple devices. Overjoyed to be rid of the
complexity of the PC they can now lie on the couch, browse the web,
check facebook (noone uses email anymore right?), order stuff from the
top tier online stores, play the odd game of the month and watch a movie
for 5 minutes before realising it&rsquo;s much better on telly. That&rsquo;s it!
They aren&rsquo;t going to be doing tax on it, not designing bathrooms, not
programming, not doing movie editing (really, c&rsquo;mon Apple). At most they
will email pictures to Gran.</p>
<p>Who loses in this consumer uptopia? The Enterprise and Linux users.</p>
<p>The Enterprise loses because they will have to suffer through Windows 8
before Microsoft realises their foolhardy mistake and continue to
produce a usable Enterprise desktop. Corporates need power computing on
the desktop. I don&rsquo;t mean CPU juice, but flexibility and enablement.
Enterprise is dependant on Microsoft and MS just isn&rsquo;t listening. I do
expect Enterprise to move to some kind of cloud offering but it&rsquo;s going
to take time and Office 365 just isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Linux loses because GNOME has completely abandoned the desktop paradigm
and at the same time not admitting it. They are rushing headlong to the
tablet interface while still attempting to coerce desktop users to come
along with them. The worst of it is they&rsquo;ve taken a whole bunch of
technologies with them (GTK, Evolution, Nautilus, etc) and left GNOME2
behind. The polite to do would be to fork GNOME2 and create a GNOME
Tablet branch. That way we could merge what technology is useful to the
desktop and leave what isn&rsquo;t. In my view Red Hat has hijacked the GNOME
project for it&rsquo;s own ends.</p>
<p>What is that end though? At GUADEC the project announced the fateful
GNOME OS. There&rsquo;s no doubt now that this will be a fedora build and that
Red Hat are testing the waters of getting into the tablet space. The
consumer ubiquitus computing market hasn&rsquo;t even  started. The desktop
era before it was troublesome and Red Hat wisely pulled out and it new
Linux just wasn&rsquo;t there yet. What chance has it really got? Probably
quite a good one. Vendors only have Google and Android to choose from.
Vendors like a good deal and they like flexability.</p>
<p>The unfortunate thing is the way Red Hat has went about this. Is taking
this gamble in what will undoubtedtly become the biggest corporate fight
in history worth wrecking the GNOME project?</p>
