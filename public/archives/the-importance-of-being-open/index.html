      <p>Last week at LCA2011, <a href="http://blog.futurestreetconsulting.com/wp-trackback.php?p=484">Mark Pesce</a> delivered a compelling keynote
speech on privacy. His premise was this;</p>
<p>We are enticed into giving up information about ourselves to closed
systems. Facebook being the worst offender. The kind of data we give up
forms a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph">social graph</a>. This graph can be used through the phenomenon
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimesis">mimesis</a> to manipulate us.</p>
<p>Let me explain that a bit more incase you&rsquo;ve failed to read Mark&rsquo;s
entire post. Mimesis is like peer group pressure. We are constantly
influenced by those around us and we constantly influence others. The
social graph provides a closed corporate entity with what we like,
dislike, who our friends are, which type of friends we talk to more
often, which type of friends influence our habits more, which topics
influence us more (or less) etc. Facebook can potentially use this
information to manipulate us. Change our habits, change our likes and
dislikes or even change our politics!</p>
<p>For some reason I&rsquo;ve been blessed with a brain that can easily
extrapolate situations and ideas to the very extreme (studying Buddhist
philosophy demands that) and can see Mark&rsquo;s apocalyptic future fairly
clearly. This gradual submission of our social data to closed systems
are pebbles in the jar of the erosion of human rights. This erosion
happens so slowly and we are so glad to be relieved of some daily
suffering by the pleasure these systems give us that we don&rsquo;t even
realise how we are already being manipulated.</p>
<p>Ultimately, by using Facebook you are committing crimes against
humanity, albiet very slowly and by proxy. Harsh but true. By
contributing to the success of closed systems you contribute to the
gradual erosion of freedom and human rights. You put more pebbles in the
jar.</p>
<p>Look at Egypt. While Mark was delivering his speech, the government
disabled the internet and people have been killed. That is the reality
we will inevitably face should we fail to wake up.</p>
<p>So what should be we do?</p>
<p><strong>The Hard Option</strong></p>
<p>Mark pretty much tells us how to resist such invasion by building a
<a href="http://www.servalproject.org/">decentralised mesh network</a> and open alternatives to closed social
networking sites. Lure people aware from Facebook and the closed systems
will become open. That is hard.</p>
<p><strong>An Easy(ish) Option</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minimise personal data in the cloud.</li>
<li>Use open source software where possible.</li>
<li>This takes your pebbles back out of the jar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, so what am I going to do? Basically the strategy is to minimise the
exposure of my personal data to closed or proprietary systems. Any
programs or systems where it involves inputting data that can be used to
profile me is a target. So things like games will mostly be exempt.</p>
<p><strong>Apple</strong></p>
<p>My home PC is a Macbook Pro. I need to install and use Linux on it
instead.</p>
<p><strong>Social Networking</strong></p>
<p>I have an identi.ca and twitter account. Noone uses Identi.ca and I&rsquo;ve
only started using Twitter since the floods. I can easily cancel both
accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong></p>
<p>This is the tricky one. Let&rsquo;s look at what I use Google for;</p>
<ol>
<li>GMail</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Android Phone (Market, Checkout etc)</li>
<li>Maps</li>
<li>Navigation</li>
<li>GoogleCode (for Traction Edge and Moolah)</li>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Blogger</li>
<li>&lt;lots more I don&rsquo;t realise&gt;</li>
</ol>
<p>Google is pretty intrinsic to my online existence. Out of all of these
the hardest ones would be the Android Phone and GMail. Everyone knows
that Google reads your email and builds a graph to sell to advertisers
but GMail will take some work to replace. The other is the Android
Phone. Even though my phone is hacked and I&rsquo;m running a pure AOSP build
on it you still need a Google Account to basically use the phone.</p>
<p>The Blogger one I&rsquo;ve knocked over already as I&rsquo;ve moved this blog to
Wordpress and made everything Creative Commons. I do realise though that
blogging in itself broadcasts social graph data but I&rsquo;m harming myself
to help others. See? Buddhist!</p>
<p>So this sets out the experiment. How much of my proprietary life can I
replace with open systems? Let&rsquo;s see.</p>
