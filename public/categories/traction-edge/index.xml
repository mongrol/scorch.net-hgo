      <title>Traction Edge Development Ceased</title>

      <description>Unfortunately TE development is now over and probably never to restart. Basically after 3 years of work I still have only a small game to show. My limited time doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave much space to make the game I envisage. C++ development is slow with a lot of my time fighting my existing code base and the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve just rushed in. It&amp;rsquo;s become too painful.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also realised that my vision isn&amp;rsquo;t fully formed.</description>

      <title>Appraise? Nah</title>

      <description>I had the appraise skill in and about to start using it when I realised I didn&amp;rsquo;t need it. What is an appraise skill anyway? It&amp;rsquo;s based on intelligence and lets you identify creatures and objects but you can&amp;rsquo;t raise it with skill points. This means UI work to avoid those untrainable skills in the list. I then reassessed why I had this skill? To test if creatures can identify other creatures and objects?</description>

      <description>Fleeing monsters are now in, they do tend to do a bit of pillar dancing in and out of FOV but I&amp;rsquo;ll fix that later. Next up though I want to get some individuality in and we can do that with the flee desire. I want monsters to have different flee characteristics.
Mindless creatures, spiders, slithers to some degree should only flee at the last resort. Larger ones should exhibit more intelligence and there lies the balancing act.</description>

      <description>My Dijkstra implementation is now in and providing some lovely pathfinding indeed. I&amp;rsquo;m now finishing up initial desires and getting monsters to flee appropriately. I&amp;rsquo;m sure my handling of the various DJ maps isn&amp;rsquo;t very efficient. After this is done I&amp;rsquo;ll move onto something else as it&amp;rsquo;s taken a few months to get it done (kids, work, the usual mental issues haven&amp;rsquo;t left much time).
I&amp;rsquo;ll have this out for ARRP 2012 then we&amp;rsquo;ll move into the tech tree area.</description>

      <description>I was fairly quick getting Dijkstra maps in for path finding but still found my monsters taking round about paths to get to targets. Exactly the same as my old code. It took an infuriatingly long time to fix as well. The problem was I was calculating every tile around the centre tile including the diagonals instead of just the orthagonal neighbours. The result was a steeper slope on the diagonals and gentler on orthos.</description>

      <description>The AI refresh is going great. I have some fantasy is my head about ditching the state machine, which technically I have. The idea is to update awareness of every loop, then update desires, and goals for those desires, based on that awareness. The final result is a djmap that the monster just roles downhill on which is towards the strongest desire. On the next step, we update our awareness and take an action if required.</description>

      <description>Firstly I just watched the talk by Icculus at Flourish 2012. Very good talk and a great overview of all the useful tools the open source community provides for game programmers. Picked up a few myself including Valgrind and I&amp;rsquo;m even more interested in Lua that I was before thought I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m quite ready yet to incorporate scripting. Video is here. Tis very good.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also started on TE&amp;rsquo;s AI refresh.</description>

      <description>So now I&amp;rsquo;ve got XP progression in and had a good play testing session. The result.
 It&amp;rsquo;s beatable until the Gimps on level 3 appear. Path finding sucks. Monsters still get stuck at map edges AI needs obvious real work XP gain grants too many skill points.  </description>

      <description>XP gain is now in. There&amp;rsquo;s a rough curve that&amp;rsquo;ll need tuning as we go but now after a map your patrolmen will have attribute points to spend on level up.
I hate UI programming. It&amp;rsquo;s just painful and timeconsuming. I first had a go at doing some window,view, object type framework ages ago which I abandoned due to inexperience. I now hard code it all into screens. My next game will have a proper framework, or most likely, use a 3rd party UI lib.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve done no dev in the last 4 weeks for a couple of main reasons. 1) I&amp;rsquo;ve been hammered by anxiety and 2) I realise that with my current game design I won&amp;rsquo;t be finished for another 3 years at my current rate. So it&amp;rsquo;s time for the Traction Edge Simplification Project.
TE is my first game and first C++ program and it shows in terms of code design. Normally new game programmers stick to simple games and get a few out before tackling something bigger.</description>

      <description>The last two weeks have been pretty hard for me as an anxiety sufferer so practically no devving has been done at all. Anxiety makes you reach for escape and distraction and this came in the form of a nearly new Nokia N900. The ultimate geeks phone. :)
Back on TE now I&amp;rsquo;m working on adding item handling functionality. I want to drop, pickup and possibly pass items around. This also makes me think of progression in terms of how we gain new items.</description>

      <title>UI Mistake Redux</title>

      <description>My last post berated my event loop and UI structure. I had a good old look at it today and some reading and I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure I&amp;rsquo;ve got it wrong after all. MVC means the view reacts to events and sends commands to the controller. The controller then translates that into an order to change the model.
In TE both my UI classes and my EngineState reacts to events so these are essentially performing the View role.</description>

      <description>Traction Edge is the one and only C++ program I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written. I didn&amp;rsquo;t start with Hello World. I just got in and started moving an @ around using SFML (then called EnemyX) and it just kept going from there. Since my dev time is quite limited and games take a lot of devtime, in order to get content in I follow this methodology.
 Implement idea using quick and dirty code with about 1 bus trips worth of thought into doing it properly and cleanly.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve now ripped through all the code and replaced any output with blah. This is an awesome little C++ logger library and has completely solved all my debug woes, std::cout spam and my poor effort at a logger. Who wants to write a perfect logger? Not me, I&amp;rsquo;d rather write game code.
Next up, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll move the level population data out into xml files.</description>

      <description>Yay! That makes 3 releases in less than 3 years. Awesome! This is the first release that I consider a playable game in that it allows you to progress through several levels of increasing difficulty with the ability to boost your skills during map intervals. I&amp;rsquo;ve also setup a new home page domain www.tractionedge.org which still goes to the Sourceforge site but means I can move it here when I eventually get some wordpress theme skills.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to do a post on my programming mistakes with Traction Edge since I started. I&amp;rsquo;ll do it soon but one item that will be in the list bit me on the bum yesterday. Because I&amp;rsquo;m such a genius, my Creature class has all it&amp;rsquo;s attributes as int&amp;rsquo;s instead of in a std::map. I&amp;rsquo;ve always had the thought this was a bad idea every time I added another attribute and it finally bit me when I tried to do the UI for level up.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re getting close to the next release. We now have skill point upgrades between levels and modified melee damage to be dependent on strength hopefully encouraging players to build tank style squaddies.
What&amp;rsquo;s left before the next release? Not a lot.
 Level up with XP gain. Every level grants you a point to spend on attributes. Better tuning of the mobs delivered with each level. I just flung some crap code in the populate levels.</description>

      <description>Now I&amp;rsquo;m back into the actual game proper and done with PCG for the time being, I&amp;rsquo;ve quickly realised that my old ranged attack code sucks quite badly. I also jammed melee attack code into it without fully realising how sucky it was. The result is some ugly components that are out of order and also are probably wrongly tightly coupled to the AI system as well.
Ah, I had good 3 months since my last re-factoring exercise.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really quite pleased with how its turned out. Not bad for a first attempt at all. It&amp;rsquo;s also flexible enough to be able to make it easy to create other map types like villages, towns, cities etc.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot.

      <description>Phew, that took some doing. For my first PCG map &amp;ldquo;farm&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;ve used Cellular Automation for tree generation. This took some tweaking to get right with some random variables liberally sprinkled to get the right amount of clumping and spacing. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want a cavern type thick forest and it was only a couple of integers away from wide open fields with only trees around the edges. Still, I&amp;rsquo;ve enough to get on with.</description>

      <description>Just had a wee play through. I&amp;rsquo;m not very happy with the state of PCG as it is. If I left it as it is I&amp;rsquo;d have to live with it for probably 6 months or more and it&amp;rsquo;ll just piss me off. So, targets are.
* Correct meandering roads and rivers.
* Correct blocks of trees
* Fill routines etc to deal with above.
The fill thing has me interested.</description>

      <description>PCG is up to a state now that I can move on a bit. Currently I have one scenario, the farm. 2 sizes of construction, random trees and a dirst road. The trees and road I&amp;rsquo;m not happy with but it&amp;rsquo;ll do just now.
I now need to figure out how progression works. Static content needs to be removed just niw then slotted in somehow later. It&amp;rsquo;s working out how the game scales the difficulty.</description>

      <description>Good progress today. A trip to Sydney resulted in much code being written on the plane and in the airport. I now have 5x5 and 10x10 building placement into a base map with the config for each scenario parsed from xml files. Next up is to tighten up the code as the rands spring up the occasional segfault. Then it&amp;rsquo;s a job of weighting the placement a bit more central so buildings aren&amp;rsquo;t so much jammed against the edges of the map.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully switched my PCG code from the convoluted BSP code to the much simpler map squares alah UFO(Xcom). The square size of 5x5 seems a nice fit too. I&amp;rsquo;ve also got masking in so buildings that don&amp;rsquo;t entirely fill the square simply overlay on top of the ground already there.
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided buildings, instead of being procedurally generated will be drawn statically and stored in a tilemap (Tiled to the rescue again).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m now plugging away at procedural maps. Maps are created for &amp;ldquo;scenarios&amp;rdquo;, e.g. Farm, Village, City, Dungeon etc. With custom code for each without obvious reuse where possible. Buildings are then generated and placed into the map where there is space. Finding space is the tricky part. At first I attempted using a BSP to divide the space up. This proved too hard as to cater for different sized buildings I had to traverse an overlapping map of &amp;ldquo;nodes&amp;rsquo; that may or may not have buildings in there children.</description>

      <description>ARRP 2011 is now two months gone and I&amp;rsquo;ve so far, in my usual slow fashion, implemented melee. I&amp;rsquo;m becoming more conscious of the usability of the interface as this is exacerbated by the success of indie games recently. User&amp;rsquo;s have higher expectations and Indie games these days have to strive to be as professional as larger company products. I thought I could get away with poor UI by sticking to the roguelike genre but now even RL&amp;rsquo;s are coming out with slick interfaces (Dredmor, Cardinal Quest).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally got another release successfully out he door last weekend. v0.2 was punted out for the ARRP 2011. Main changes were updated AI, reaction fire and stats affecting gameplay.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m only distributing source, and since the source is always available and a release is only a sort of stable branch, I&amp;rsquo;m going to aim at more regular releases. Here&amp;rsquo;s the next features coming up.
 Melee Opening Doors Civilians and more mobs.</description>

      <description>My coding fruition reaches new lows as it&amp;rsquo;s taken nearly 10 weeks to implement a save game feature. My god that was dull. In the end though, it actually turned out easier, and more monotonous than I thought. Loading all the data in and bootstrapping the game at whatever screen I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen was a minimum of fuss and did show up some bad design decisions made during my &amp;ldquo;just get it in and working&amp;rdquo; coding sprees.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m now starting to implement the savegame feature in Traction Edge. A worthwhile and necessary task that&amp;rsquo;s sure to propel it into the annals of gaming history. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly tedious though. I&amp;rsquo;m using TinyXML so that&amp;rsquo;s the file IO burden removed but trawling through all the objects needing to be saved out is already irritating me and I&amp;rsquo;ve only been at it for an hour.
Still, it can&amp;rsquo;t all be glamourous coding of AI and accidentally asymmetric field of view algorithms can it?</description>

      <description>An important feature of any XCom-a-like is opportunity fire, or reaction fire. This means when you click to move your wee man and he starts moving towards his destination, if an enemy see&amp;rsquo;s him there&amp;rsquo;s a chance of the opposition getting a free shot at him, during your turn, if they have action points and win some kind of initiative. This also means that you can &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; points during your turn for possible reaction fire during the enemies turn.</description>

      <description>My second iteration of TE&amp;rsquo;s AI has finally reached some kind of stability. It&amp;rsquo;s the first draft of a fairly basic state machine with a few bits of bandaid over my rushed code.
The FSM consists of Patrol state, Attack State and Run State. Each state, during update will run an awareness update (process fov) then make some decisions based on what it can see and also what the creatures present condition is.</description>
